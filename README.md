# Next Level Abstraction

This project is created as an educational aid. It models a simplistic world with an office building that contains floors and elevators.

A number of people are arriving to work and leaving after work, following a number of scripted behaviors (arriving early or late, going out
for lunch etc.).

The exercise challenges you to find an optimal control program for the elevators in the building in order to transport people to their
destinations using the least amount of steps (as a symbol of time), while doing basic moves. Good luck finding the right level of
abstraction for modeling the behavior of people in order to let your elevators serve them best!
